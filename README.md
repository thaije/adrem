Biased Bagging for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
--------------------------

This is the implementation of the AdREM method for domain adaptation, plus accompanying code to test it on a variety of datasets.

The method itself is implemented in `src/adrem/predict_adrem.m`.
Example:

    addpath src/adrem
    addpath src/evaluation
    data = load_dataset('amazon');
    % Predict labels of 'dvd' target domain using 'books' as source
    % Preprocess data: divide by standard deviation over both domains
    [x_src, x_tgt] = preprocess(data.x{1}, data.y{1}, data.x{2}, 'joint-std');
    y = predict_adrem(x_src, data.y{1}, x_tgt);
    mean(y == data.y{2})

The method requires that the MATLAB/octave bindings for liblinear are installed. These can be downloaded from https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/

As a starting point for the experiments, look at `src/evaluation/run_methods.m`.
